// Languages model: This is the top-level model for natural langauge defintions
// Proteus: beta
// Language: en

// Natural languages are tightly integrated with Proteus syntax so these are quite important.
// Contributers, please add your own lauguage or any artificial languages you know or created.
// NOTE: Adding a language to the Proteus Core involves coding in C++. Please ask for help on the mailing list.
